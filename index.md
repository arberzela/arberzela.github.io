## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Freiburg advised by Prof. Frank Hutter. Since 2020 I am also an ELLIS PhD student co-advised by Prof. Yee Whye Teh at the University of Oxford. I am currently living close to Basel, Switzerland and working in Freiburg, Germany.

## Research Interests

- **Neural Architecture Search:** multi-objective optimization, structural pruning, benchmarking
- **In-Context Learning:** Linear RNNs, Reasoning, Test-Time Scaling

## News

- **[Feb. 2025]** 2 papers accepted at ICLR 2025. "Multi-objective Differentiable Neural Architecture Search" as a Poster and "Unlocking State-Tracking in Linear RNNs Through Negative Eigenvalues" as an Oral.
- **[Oct. 2024]** 3 papers accepted at NeurIPS 2024 workshops: "Unlocking State-Tracking in Linear RNNs Through Negative Eigenvalues" (Oral), "GAMformer" (Poster), and "Ensembling Finetuned Language Models for Text Classification" (Poster).
- **[Sep. 2024]** "HW-GPT-Bench: Hardware-Aware Architecture Benchmark for Language Models" was accepted to NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track.
- **[Jun. 2024]** "Multi-objective Differentiable Neural Architecture Search" was accepted to the WANT workshop at ICML 2024.
- **[Jul. 2023]** "Neural architecture search for dense prediction tasks in computer vision" published at IJCV.
