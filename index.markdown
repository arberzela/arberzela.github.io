## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the ELLIS Insitute Tübingen, Germany. Before I was an ELLIS Ph.D. student at the University of Freiburg advised by Frank Hutter and co-advised by Yee Whye Teh at the University of Oxford. Since 2025 I am also an ELLIS member.

## Research Interests

- **AutoML:** Neural Architecture Search, Structural Pruning, Benchmarking
- **In-Context Learning:** Linear RNNs, Reasoning, Test-Time Scaling
- **Global Optimization:** Bayesian Optimization, Multi-objective Optimization, Bandits
